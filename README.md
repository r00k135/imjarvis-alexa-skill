## Functions Implemented

Alexa, ask Jarvis:

* whats the temperature outside - ask imjarvis what the outside temperature is

## Install
Download latest code from github
> git clone https://github.com:r00k135/imjarvis-alexa-skill.git

Create an override file called: *imjarvis-alexa-skill-override.json*, use the following format and replace the defaults with your actual values so lamdba can access your imjarvis server:
```
{
	"imjarvisApiHost" : "<ip or dynamicDNS host name>",
	"imjarvisApiPort" : <HTTP Port Number - no speech marks needed>,
	"imjarvisApiPath" : "/<randomURL from Reverse Proxy>/jsonrpc",
	"applicationId" : "<applicationId>"
}
```

Ensure that you have the AWS Command Line Tools (CLI) configured (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#AWS_Command_Line_Interface) with an IAM user who can update lambda function.

Create Lambda Function, as described here, called *imjarvis-control*: https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/deploying-a-sample-skill-to-aws-lambda#Creating%20the%20Lambda%20Function%20for%20the%20Sample

In order to build your zip file and upload, run the release.sh script:
> ./release.sh
